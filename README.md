# ConvolutionLayerCNN

Use TPU in colab please. 

 Build_high_performance_vision_classifiers_.ipynb

a) Demonstrate how convolution layers themselves work visually in colab

b) implement depth wise pooling layer in keras and demonstrate its use

c) 

Part 2:  

Three colabs with  vision classifiers - data  - mnist, fashion mnist and cifar 10

demonstrate for each colab : Build high performance vision classifiersPART2 .ipynb

a) use simple neural network as well as lenet-5  - two architectures

 b) demonstrate pretrained model with transfer learning  (both efficient net and BiT)

c) Demonstrate imge augmentation 

d) demonstrate with state of art image models - mlp-mixer

 

Part 3:

 

a) Xray pnemonea classification with convnet - Xray.ipynb

b) 3d image classication of ctscan - CTscans_3D_image_classification.ipynb
